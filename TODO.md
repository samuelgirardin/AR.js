- pack the TODO.md and all, then switch to webvr-polyfill until it works for three.js demo, then for a-frame demo
- aframe/examples/demo.html is buggy
  - TODO handle resize
  - fix javascript exception
  - find a new name e.g. parameters.html
  - check you got all the parameters
- option simplification in a-frame
  - remove that by using baseURL - cameraParametersUrl: https://rawgit.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js/master/data/data/camera_para.dat
  - support <a-marker preset='hiro'> to be equal to type='pattern' url='https://rawgit.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js/master/data/data/patt.hiro'
  - same for kanji

# fixing projectionMatrix
- got something working in a-frame
- understand it and port it directly in the threex

# webvr-polyfill
- GOAL: works well using only the positional tracking, not the stereo display
  - thus it works well with all three.js examples
- handle resize - currently the canvas isnt using the css it should
  - canvas is sent to the webvr with .requestPresent(layer)
- webvr polyfill to present in single screen - like smus/webvr-polyfill
  - look at his tuning and do the same
  - just do the call on the webvr-polyfill and see his framedata and all
- issue with the projection matrix being inverse in y and z
- LATER: make it work with a-frame

# Profile
- do a threex-artoolkitprofile.js with various performance profile
  - var arToolKitProfile = new THREEx.ARToolKitProfile(type)
  - may be dynamic - for resolution - 'dynamic'
  - type = 'phoneInHand' || 'desktop'
  - thus the user can go a in profiler.html and try various profiles until he find the one he needs
  - then we store that in a cookie, and other applications all use this profile
  - cookie/localstorage makes it stored on the browser, need one profiler per domain tho
  - but no database and no authentication needed
- DONE artoolkit-profile.html to store the profile in localstorage
  - it allows you to select which profile you like
  - it has a <select> and store it in the storage - desktop-normal - phone-normal - phone-slow - dynamic
  - in ctor, if there is a local storage use this

# TODO
- fix projection camera which inversing y axis, and looking toward positive z
  - this affect webvr polyfill in three.js demo
- currently the source image ratio is always in 640x480 :(
  - the aspect of the webcam should depends on the screens
  - it will improve the accuracy of the marker detection. trackable from further away

# Idea about performance - js profiling
- do it on canary. this is the most advanced tool for that
  - POST: optimising AR.js with chromedevtools
- more than 70% of the time is used to copy the image in the HEAP
  - .drawImage, .getImageData
  - this.dataHeap.set( data ) is 43% of the total
  - if i can send just a pointer on the data... i gain 43% in one shot
- performance remove copy to heap
  - http://kapadia.github.io/emscripten/2013/09/13/emscripten-pointers-and-pointers.html
  - this explains how to pass a pointer from a typearray to c++ 
  - this would avoid the dataHeap.set() - 43%
